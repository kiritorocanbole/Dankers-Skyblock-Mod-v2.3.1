<summary>Custom Music</summary>

## Custom Music
1. Place a music file with the given name in the `.minecraft/config/dsmmusic` folder:
  - Dungeon: `dungeon.wav`
  - Blood room: `bloodroom.wav`
  - Dungeon boss: `dungeonboss.wav`
  - Dungeon hub: `dungeonhub.wav`
  - F7 Phase 2 (Storm): `phasetwo.wav`
  - F7 Phase 3 (Goldor): `phasethree.wav`
  - F7 Phase 4 (Necron): `phasefour.wav`
  - F7 Phase 5 (Wither King): `phasefive.wav`
  - Hub: `hub.wav`
  - Private Island: `island.wav`
  - Farming Islands: `farmingislands.wav`
  - Garden: `garden.wav`
  - Gold Mine: `goldmine.wav`
  - Deep Caverns: `deepcaverns.wav`
  - Dwarven Mines: `dwarvenmines.wav`
  - Crystal Hollows: `crystalhollows.wav`
  - Spider's Den: `spidersden.wav`
  - Crimson Isle: `crimsonisle.wav`
  - Kuudra: `kuudra.wav`
  - The End: `end.wav`
  - The Park: `park.wav`
2. Either run `/dsmmusic reload` or restart your game.
3. Enable the custom music in `/dsm`.
4. (Optional) Change the volume of the music with `/dsmmusic volume`.

#### Shuffling
By adding numbers to the end of the file, you can have multiple music files for the same area. One of them will be randomly selected (the same song could play twice in a row). For example:
- dungeon.wav
- dungeon1.wav
- dungeon2.wav
- dungeon99.wav

<summary>Alert Regex</summary>

## Alert Regex
To replace alert text with a captured group, add `$$x$$` to the alert text, with `x` being the number of the capture group. `$$0$$` will always be replaced with the entire trigger message.

For example, with the following alert

Regex: `From (.*) (.*): (.*)`  
Alert Text: `$$2$$ says $$3$$`  
Trigger Message: `From [ADMIN] Plancke: Nice autogg`  

the following alert text would appear

`Plancke says Nice autogg`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

### Notes
- Slayer tracker for token drops and 20% chance drops uses a 12x12x12 bounding box centered on the player to detect the drops. If you are out of the range of the item drop, it will not count on the tracker.
- API commands may take a while depending on your internet connection. The API may also go down.
- If you use too many API commands too fast, you can and will get rate-limited.
- Importing fishing uses your sea creature kills, which may not always be exactly correct (e.x. someone else kills your sea creature).
